# PajtimGG
This is a project of a student. The goal is to query the data of a summoner in the backend area with Python via the REST interface of Riot Games. 
In the frontend the data is displayed nicely and the page is made interactive for the user. The focus is clearly at the frontend, because I want to 
learn TypeScript and React.

## What I used for the Software Architecture
### Backend 
Python, Uvicorn with FastAPI, LolWatcher, PyLint
### Frontend
Vite, React, TypeScript, EsLint, Prettier, CSS, MUI, Axios

## How to setup PajtimGG
### Setting up the Backend 
```
  cd backend 
  pip install -r requirements.txt (for Windows User)

```
### Setting up the Frontend
